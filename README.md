This can be used to create backups for large number of devices.93% more efficient to use over an application like Putty.



In Order to use this Program, do the following: 

1.) Download the "Scriptt.zip" folder.This is a package I made which handles all libraries/plugins. Just Easy download and run
2.) Decompress the folder 
3.) Ensure that yourcomputer has access to the devices you are trying to SSH 
4.) Input y all ip addresses (host names) that you are trying to capture data from in a text file, making sure each line has a different hostname
5.) Save the text file as "ip.txt" and input it inside the folder 
6.) Run the executable file named " Script.exe" 
7.) Follow all instructions the program gives you 
8.) You are now Done









Another Way to run to program:

An unexectuable version of the program can be found in "Script.py ". You can run this from your terminal, just make sure that the file is saved in the same directory as your "ip.txt" file. You have to ensure that you have python, paramiko and pycrypto downloaded on your computer.
